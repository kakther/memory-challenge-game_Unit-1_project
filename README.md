# Introduction

This app is a deliverable for an assignment in for my General Assembly curriculum for JavaScript Objects.  The goal is to create a browser game that makes the user challenge their brain to play the game.

See *Appendix A: Assignment from General Assembly* for more information.

# Version Notes

The version of this app currently uploaded is 1.0.0.  In cases where I update the README without any updates to the website itself I do not update the version number or use branches for my work.  Each version number will lack a commit number until the next version is uploaded.  The commit number is always added retroactively as it's generated at the time that I commit the project.  In general, for version number format X.Y.Z:

# Instructions for User
1. Ensure your set of cards contains all matching pairs.
2. Shuffle and spread all cards out on a flat surface, face down.
3. Players take it in turns to choose any two cards. Make a successful match and you get to take another turn. No match, the cards are returned to their original position.
4. Success in Memory relies upon children remembering where they have seen each picture in previous turns â€“ both those and those of the other players.
5. The winner is the person who has matched the most pairs.


# How I build the Memory Game 
I maniulated the DOM the Vanila JS, altered part of the HTML and also styed the game 
    . create a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed 
    .
